# balltwist
Small Unity3D project to utilize LWRP and shader graphs in real app. 

"Ball Twister" was originally released about an year ago and it was using standard Unity render pipeline and shaders. 
I did not advertise it too much because of boring outlook and bit simple gameplay. However, now I have found this game
perfect for testing scriptable render pipeline and shader graphs in real 3D environment. Enhanced version 
is using LWRP (or URP) and shader graphs. 

In enhanced version, rolling checker board texture, swirling sky and obstacle materials are all using shader graphs
to create a sense of movement just by tweaking textures. Basically, only objects that are really moved are black
obstacles and coins. Everything else stands still.

The resulting game is still more or less playable demo, but you can download Ball Twister from Google Play Store:
